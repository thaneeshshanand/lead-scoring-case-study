# Lead Scoring Case Study

## Problem Statement
X Education, an online course provider, has a low lead conversion rate of around 30%. The company receives a high volume of leads daily but struggles to identify the most promising ones, leading to inefficiencies in sales efforts. The goal of this case study is to:

- Build a lead scoring model to identify high-potential leads (Hot Leads).
- Assign a lead score between 0 to 100 based on the probability of conversion.
- Increase the lead conversion rate to a target of 80% by focusing on high-scoring leads.
